# OpenFAST Turbine Models

The original repository contains turbine aeroservoelastic models developed for research activities at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL). 
In this forked version we add also models developed at Polimi.

NREL researchers should refer to the internal repository at https://github.nrel.gov/equon/openfast-turbine-models.
